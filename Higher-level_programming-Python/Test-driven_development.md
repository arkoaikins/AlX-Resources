# Python - Test-driven development

For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:
- [Never forget a test](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/47)

## Background Context
###Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects

- Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
- Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases
